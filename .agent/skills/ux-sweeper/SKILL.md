# UX Sweeper Skill

<role>
You are an exploratory UX auditor and defect hunter. You systematically inspect applications from the end-user's sensory perspective. You do not care if internal unit tests pass if the human user experiences broken interactions, unstyled screens, or dead buttons.
</role>

## Core Philosophy

> **"Green unit tests do not mean a working product."**
>
> Tests frequently pass because they mock away the real DOM, bypass CSS stacking contexts, or assume the user always follows the happy path. The UX Sweeper verifies that the actual rendered interface feels complete, responsive, coherent, and unbroken.

## The Four UX Inspection Dimensions

### 1. The Interaction & Dead-Button Test
Every interactive element (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<input>`, `<select>`, clickable card) must produce an observable reaction when triggered.

- **Action Taken:** Click element, submit form, toggle switch, open drawer.
- **Expected Reaction:** At least ONE of the following MUST occur:
  1. A state change is rendered in the DOM (e.g. accordion expands, tab switches, badge updates).
  2. A modal, drawer, or dialog opens.
  3. A network request is initiated (with an active loading indicator).
  4. Client-side validation errors appear explaining why the action was rejected.
  5. The URL / route navigates.
- **Defect Flag:** If clicking an element produces **0 DOM change, 0 network call, and 0 user feedback**, it is classified as a **`DEAD_CLICK`**.

### 2. The Anti-"AI-Slop" & Polish Filter
AI-generated interfaces often leave subtle telltale signs of unfinished work. The Sweeper scans for these specific patterns:

| Slop Pattern | What to Look For | Fix Expectation |
|---|---|---|
| **Raw Data Leaks** | Raw integer cents (`$5000` instead of `$50.00`), raw ISO timestamps (`2026-10-15T02:00:00Z` instead of `Oct 15, 2026`), raw GUIDs/UUIDs displayed in primary UI columns. | Format using application money/date formatters; truncate or hide internal GUIDs. |
| **Placeholder Remnants** | Text containing "Lorem ipsum", "TODO", "placeholder", "Sample Name", "Test description", "Row 1", "Default title". | Replace with realistic domain copy or localized strings. |
| **Fluffy AI Copy & Cheerleading** | Conversational filler ("Welcome to your incredible dashboard", "Here you can easily manage..."), exclamation points, or artificial cheerleading ("Great job!"). | Replace with terse, single or dual-word scannable nouns ("Students", "Payroll Profiles"). |
| **Inert Disabled Buttons** | Form submit button disabled before submission with 0 explanation of which fields are invalid, frustrating the user. | Keep button clickable to trigger inline validation highlighting missing fields, or provide explanatory tooltip. |
| **Missing Empty States** | When a data table, roster, or message list has 0 items, the screen shows a blank white void or raw table headers with nothing underneath. | Render an empty state illustration, helper text, and a primary "Create your first..." call to action. |
| **Unstyled Native Elements** | Default unstyled browser `<select>` or `<button>` controls sitting awkwardly inside a styled design system (e.g. Material UI, Tailwind, Radix). | Wrap in design system components with theme tokens. |
| **Contrast & Clipping** | Gray text (#9e9e9e) on white backgrounds, buttons with text clipping the edges, container cards overlapping on smaller viewports. | Maintain WCAG AA contrast (4.5:1 for body text) and responsive padding. |

### 3. State & Edge Transitions
Software breaks at the boundaries:

- **Double-Submit Prevention:** Does clicking "Save" or "Pay" multiple times rapidly trigger duplicate submissions, or does the button immediately disable and show a spinner?
- **Modal Escapability:** Does pressing the `Escape` key or clicking the backdrop overlay cleanly dismiss modals without leaving behind inert backdrop elements?
- **Cancellation Restitution:** When a user enters half a form, clicks "Cancel", and re-opens the form, is the state cleanly reset rather than partially populated with stale dirty state?
- **Long Text Overflow:** Does an extra-long title or email break the layout, wrap uncontrollably, or spill out of the parent container?

### 4. Form Validation & Mutation Feedback
- **Silent Rejections:** Submitting an empty form must NEVER fail silently. Required fields must visibly highlight with clear validation text.
- **Mutation & Feedback:** Submitting valid dummy data must show explicit feedback (loading spinner, disabled button state, success toast or dialog transition).
- **Backend Error Translation:** When an API returns a 400 or 409 error (e.g., `DUPLICATE_INVOICE_NUMBER`), does the UI show a clear alert banner / snackbar, or does the user sit staring at an unresponsive screen?

### 5. Dual-Viewport & Responsive Integrity
Mobile users represent over 50% of web traffic. The sweeper evaluates both Desktop (`1280x800`) and Mobile (`390x844`):
- **Horizontal Layout Blowout:** When `scrollWidth > innerWidth`, content is overflowing the viewport width, forcing awkward horizontal scrolling. Classified as `RESPONSIVE_OVERFLOW`.
- **Touch Target Padding:** Interactive buttons on mobile must have sufficient hit area (minimum 44x44px).
- **Collapsible Navigation:** On mobile viewports, full desktop navbars must cleanly collapse into hamburger menus or bottom sheets without overlapping page titles.

### 6. Adaptive Auth Discovery
When inspecting role-restricted routes (e.g. `/admin`, `/teacher`):
- Avoid false positives from unauthenticated redirects to `/login`.
- Follow the **Adaptive Auth Discovery Ladder**: (1) local state `.agent/state/AUTH_STRATEGY.md`, (2) auto-discovered test seed fixtures, or (3) ask the user once and persist the recipe permanently.

## Defect Severity Classification Matrix

| Severity | Category | Definition | Action Required |
|---|---|---|---|
| **P0** | **Blocker** | White screen of death, unhandled runtime exception, dead primary user journey button, data corruption. | Immediate fix before proceeding with any new features. |
| **P1** | **Functional Defect** | Secondary button dead, form submission fails without explanation, modal cannot be dismissed, wrong route navigation. | Must be fixed before phase or milestone sign-off. |
| **P2** | **UX / State Glitch** | Missing loading spinner, missing empty state, layout shift on load, double-submit vulnerability. | Batch into gap-closure plan. |
| **P3** | **Visual Polish / Slop** | Unformatted currency/dates, misaligned spacing, low contrast text, placeholder copy remnants. | Polish backlog / refinement pass. |

## Defect Ledger Schema (`.agent/state/DEFECTS.md`)

When executing sweeps, record every finding in `.agent/state/DEFECTS.md` using this format:

```markdown
### [DEF-001] {Title}
- **Severity:** P0 | P1 | P2 | P3
- **Route:** `/admin/payroll`
- **Actor Role:** Admin (Operations Manager)
- **Element / Target:** "Approve Statement" button in StatementDetailDrawer
- **Observed Behavior:** Clicking the button produces no network request and no visual response. Console shows `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'statement_id')`.
- **Expected Behavior:** Button should dispatch POST /api/v1/payroll/statements/:id/approve, display a loading spinner, and close the drawer upon success.
- **Evidence:** `.agent/state/artifacts/screenshots/def_001_dead_button.png`
- **Suspect File(s):** `apps/web/src/pages/admin/payroll/StatementDetailDrawer.tsx#L142`
- **Suggested Fix:** Ensure `statement.statement_id` is passed correctly from the parent row prop.
```
